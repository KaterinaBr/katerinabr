Hello!

My name is Katerina, I' m 26 years old and I am a designer. I live in Athens, in an apartment full of board games and a balcony full of plants. I also have a cat and a water turtle, who I think together they are planning to conquer the world someday.

I studied at the University of the Aegean, at the Department of Product and Systems Design Engineering, in the beautiful island of Syros. Over the years, I have worked as a graphic designer, junior game developer and product designer.

Anyway, you can check my online portfolio here and you can find me on {% include icon-github.html username=site.github_username %} and on {% include icon-linkedin.html username=site.linkedin_username %}.

Have a nice day :)
